I am a simple man, ICT lover and generalist. I never thought of becoming an specialist in just one field. Always looking for new tools and improving existing workflows and processes.
I've started in the private sector and then went to the government.
Along the way, I have integrated many different teams with different goals, from infrastructure to development.
I believe that every team has a contribution to the professional handyman evolution.
